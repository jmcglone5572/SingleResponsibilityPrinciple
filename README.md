# SingleResponsibilityPrinciple
Example implementation of the Single Responsibility Principle.
Taken from "Adaptive Code via C#", Chapter 5.
Each branch of this repository illustrates stages of a refactoring process that successively converts a class
containing many responsibilities into a set of classes that satisfy the single responsibility principle. The initial
behavior of the class is preserved while greatly improving the adaptability of the code.
